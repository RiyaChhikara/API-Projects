# API Projects
This is a collection of data science projects integrating popular APIs like Spotify, Openweather, Twilio etc. 

## What is an API? 
API or Application Programming Interface 

## About JSON
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is the format for most of the APIs responses. 
The data is mostly in key-value pairs. Keys are strings in double quotes. The values can be strings, numbers, arrays, boolean or null. In this way, the data is in a nested format. 
[] means an array of object (a list) and {} means it will be an object.
```
{
  "name": "Riya",
  "courses": [
    "MY_472",
    "ST_449"
  ],
  "grades": [
    87,
    94
  ],
  "Supervisor": {
    "name": "Dan",
    "Department": "Methodology"
    }
  }
```

## How APIs work? 
You send a request to the internet. API delivers the request to the web server, accesses the database. 
Most APIs need a token/ key. Most APIs are rate limited for the amount of requests you can send over a period of time. 

## Types of APIs
1. RESTful APIs: Like taking snapshot of static data
2. Streaming APIs: For data that chnages in real time like Openweather, social media

## Documentation on APIs
1. Endpoints: A web location that recieves requests and sends responses.
2. Parameters: Allow you to send specific requests
